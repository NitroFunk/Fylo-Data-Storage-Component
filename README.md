# Fylo-Data-Storage-Component


This data challenge seemed a bit mind cluttering when i first worked on it, 

(Because i'm still learning Frontend and Backend Web Development)

so i took the method of "prototyping" which made the website look closer to the challenge question.

and it was easier to follow up with accurate guidelines and margin setup with less difficulty of coding!
